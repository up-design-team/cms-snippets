  An example of a YouTube embed.
  Please note:
  1 You can add a preferred timestamp that you'd like your video to start
    playing from. To do so, append `&start=[ADD START TIME]` to the `<iframe>`
    tag's `src` attribute. Replace `[ADD START TIME]` with the timestamp you'd
    like the video to start playing from. For example, if you'd like the video
    to play from 01:30 (one minute, 30 seconds), then you'd append `&start=90`.
  2 You can add a preferred timestamp that you'd like your video to stop
    playing at. To do so, append `&end=[ADD END TIME]` to the `<iframe>` tag's
    `src` attribute. Replace `[ADD END TIME]` with the timestamp you'd like the
    video to stop playing at. For example, if you'd like the video to stop at
    02:45 (two minutes, 45 seconds), then you'd append `&end=165`.
